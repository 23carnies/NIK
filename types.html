        <p>Hello and welcome to my quilt shop. I'm Dorothy and we are
        not in Kansas anymore. I've been making quilts for my family
        and friends for years. I'd love to make one for yours too! Quilts
        make great show pieces for your bed, couch or even wall hangings.
        I make them in many sizes from baby blanket to California King and
        everything in between. </p>

        <p>A quilt is a fantastic gift. One that will be passed
          down for generations. My quilts are put together by hand
          and quilted by machine. They are sturdy and beautiful.</br> There are
          many designs and colors. Check out our gallery of quilts and find one
          you like. I can adjust the colors to fit your room.

        <p>Have a stack of t-shirts from sports or group events?
          Have them made into a commemorative T-shirt quilt. These
          keepsakes allow you to display your treasured shirts and
          keep you warm at night.</p>
